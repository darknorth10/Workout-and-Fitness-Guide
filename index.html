								<h2>Average Diet Plan</h2>
								<p>The following meal plan provides options for 7 days of meals and snacks. The plan consists of nutrient-dense whole foods.
A person should determine the appropriate portion sizes, according to their weight loss goals, activity levels, and individual requirements.

								<h2>Underweight Diet Plan</h2>
								<p>Just like obesity causes health concerns, having less weight than the normal also poses health issues. Being underweight can be result of poor nutrition and should be a matter of concern. If the body does not receive adequate amounts of nutrients, the body fails to function to its utmost. This could result in the imbalance in the metabolism. Inculcating a healthy diet for underweight will provide the necessary nutrients for better functioning of the body.<br>To deal with underweight, maintaining a proper nutritious diet is important. We create a weight gain meal plan for underweight, easily followed by both males and females. We try to add food with high-calorie foods for underweight adults. This diet meal plan is used to provide the right nutrients, vitamins, and minerals required by the body. You can easily buy food items listed in the underweight diet meal plan in your local markets.

								<h2>Overweight Diet Plan</h2>
								<p>A low fat diet, as the name implies, is a dietary pattern that limits the fat intake at about 1/3 of the total daily calories consumed. It consists of little fat, particularly saturated fats and cholesterol which lead to increased blood cholesterol levels and heart attack.<br>This type of diet plan to reduce obesity focuses on foods that contain whole grains, fruits and vegetables. It is directed towards weight loss and treatment of certain diseases by offering 20 to 30 percent of total daily calories from fat. Plenty of vegetables and proteins in a typical low fat diet supply the body with energy but very little fats.
